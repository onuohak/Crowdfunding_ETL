# Crowdfunding_ETL
Built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and  regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. 

Uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

List of Deliverable:
